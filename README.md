A simple Python painting program for basic drawing and doodling. It is inspired by DeluxePaint and similar 1980s paint software.

Requires PyGame

### Main features

* Fixed canvas size (1200x800 px), but can load pictures in other sizes. (Images larger than the canvas are scaled down to fit.)
* Drawing tools: pen (dotted and continuous), straight lines, quadratic BÃ©zier curves, airbrush, and flood fill
* Several included palettes
* Single-level undo
* Saves files as PNG with automatic filename selection

### Usage

    python pypaint.py [input image]

#### Keyboard

* **P**: Switch to different ***p***alette
* **T**: Switch drawing ***t***ool
* **B**: Toggle ***b***rush size (large/small)
* **M**: Toggle text ***m***arker / highlighter mode: The dotted pen now only affects background color pixels, effectively drawing behind other colors on the canvas. This mode is also toggled by clicking on the dotted pen icon. (It is similar to using a stencil in DeluxePaint.)

* **H**: ***H***ide palette
* **C**: ***C***olor picker: gets active color from pixel at mouse position
